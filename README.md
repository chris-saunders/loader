# Loader

A self-contained loader written for Backbone.JS


## Instructions

Create a path to the loader's scripts directory in your top level require config with the key "loader".


### Notes

I can't think of a better way to structure this component for use with Require.JS + Backbone.JS. I'm open to suggestions!


### Licencing

I don't know enough about licencing software to understand where Loader stands. Anyone can use it for personal or commerical use!
